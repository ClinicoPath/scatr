# scatman

This jamovi module allows you to create nice scatter plots in [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org). The module is still in beta development so any comments and contributions are well appreciated.

You can already try out the module by downloading the [scatman.jmo](https://github.com/raviselker/scatman/raw/master/scatman.jmo) file and [sideloading](http://imgur.com/a/mFv7t) it into jamovi.
